# What

ETrade support for the Trading Tool Kit.

# How

Most of these classes implement an interface that the TTK supports via duck typing. If the interface is followed, then this stuff Just Works.

# Plans

1. Make it work
2. Make it right
3. Make it fast

Still in phase #1 where I'm making it work. When I get to "make it right" then there will be additional refactors and lots of unit and integration tests. This code needs to be trustworhty. While it currently works, it needs tests to make sure it continues to work.
