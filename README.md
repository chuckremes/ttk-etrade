# What

ETrade support for the Trading Tool Kit.

# How

Most of these classes implement an interface that the TTK supports via duck typing. If the interface is followed, then this stuff Just Works.

# Structure

    accounts ->
              |
              - account --               -  EquityPosition
                         |- balances     |- OptionPosition
                         |- positions ---|- SpreadPosition
                         |- orders       -  FuturesPosition

# Rate Limits

ETrade REST API v1 (circa 2018) has the following rate limits per their support team.

* Accounts Module = 35,600 / hour or 9.8 / second
* Markets Module = 140,000 / hour or 38.8 / second
* Orders Module = 17,800 / hour or 4.9 / second
* Users Module = 35,600 / hour or 9.8 / second

They note that Options Chains use the Markets module so 
downloading lots of chains repeatedly can rapidly consume
the quota. Each OptionPair associated with a strike in an
option chain is considered as 2 quote requests. So
downloading a chain with 50 strikes for CallPut will 
consume 100 quote requests for that hour. Downloading
many chains repeatedly can rapidly consume the whole 
140k hourly limit. On 2022/01/15 I confirmed with ETrade
API support that the Markets Module limit is 140k
quotes per hour. It has nothing to do with request count
since when a single request contains _N_ symbols then it
consumes _N_ quotes from the 140k limit. They did not
clarify if this is true for other Modules, e.g. if
a large Portfolio with 100 positions counts as 100
messages consumed from the Accounts Module.

It is best to download the chains once and cache them. 
In this system, the `OptionPair` is converted to an
internal `Quote` type so they can be easily updated. 
So it downloads chains once and then registers its 
constituent options for market data subscription and 
updates them in-place.

# Plans

1. Make it work
2. Make it right
3. Make it fast

Now in Phase 2 to Make It Right. Many refactors have
occurred and many more will occur. Lots of tests have
been written and run regularly to minimize regressions.
These have mostly been unit or small integration tests.

Work on larger integration tests that exercise a complex
piece of the system like Order management need to be
written before the system can be trusted with money
again. 

### Required Integration Tests
* Downloading a Position immediately returns the correct
and up-to-date Greeks
* Create an order, submit it, and change it successfully
* When computing an exit price, revisit the entire roll
history of the position to accumulate all credits/debits
and calc the right exit price
* With some open positions and some open unexecuted orders,
confirm that the strategy enforces appropriate
position limits and restricts opening further orders
# Notes

The long term plan is to provide access to multiple
brokers without requiring any changes to the
strategies. I am abstracting away the broker differences.
Ruby's duck typing plays a major role in this effort.

The `ttk-containers` gem defines the standard interfaces
for all major objects. Using modules and a set of
shared specs, broker implementations can include
those modules and execute those shared specs to confirm
that the broker code adheres to the correct interfaces.

For ETrade, most of the concrete implementations occur
in the market, portfolio, account, and order 
namespaces. Under each namespace is a `containers`
directory that defines a `Response` class which wraps
the raw JSON response from the broker API. These
classes are a thin fa√ßade or presentation pattern
around the broker data to transform it into the data
format expected by the higher level TTK code.

These response classes `include` the modules from
`ttk-containers` and their specs delegate a lot of the
testing to the shared specs from that gem too. This
ensures that the ETrade responses conform to the
correct container API and behavior.

Also, in many cases we define a wrapper container at
`ttk/etrade/containers` which wrap the `Response` objects
and *delegate* all calls to them. This wrapper 
provides a simple mechanism for updating the 
containers with new responses as new data flows in
from the API. Other
code may hold a reference to the wrapper container.
When an update arrives, we can swap in a new Response
object (see `__setobj__`) to update the contents
without disturbing the wrapper reference object!

This is particularly useful for quotes which update
regularly. We avoid the complexity of a pub/sub
architecture for the simplicity of direct object 
updates. It also neatly handles a one-to-many update
structure. There may be multiple distinct wrapper
objects all wrapping the exact same Response object
(though this isn't a pattern to encourage). Smart Boys
will note that this is probably not thread-safe and no
work has been done to make it so; that's out of
scope for now.
